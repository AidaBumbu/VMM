Read the BIN file. The program right now outputs the bin file contents. 

Reading from file done.
The bin file items are stored in buffer.
The addresses are stored in entriez.
If you wish to change the names of the variables go ahead.

Change (line 72) while loop to read addresses to read file instead (so we can get rid of the vector addressEntries)
